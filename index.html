Relay For Life by Singapore Cancer Society</h1>

<p> Relay For Life (RFL) is a global movement founded by the American Cancer Society in May 1985. Around 4 million participants partake in RFL globally every year, making it one of the world's largest fundraisers. Since 1985, this event has raised more than $5 billion worldwide to fight cancer.</p>
<p>Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) aims to rally the community together to celebrate the lives of those who battled cancer, remember loved ones lost and fight back against the disease that has taken so much from so many people.</p>
